            lacking equity in your home, don't worry! Although it may be
            challenging to buy a home if its value is lower than the mortgage,
            there are still opportunities in many markets where home values are
            skyrocketing. To learn more about your specific situation, fill out
            the form or give us a call and one of our acquisition team members
            will be glad to answer any of your questions. They can provide quick
            answers about market conditions, the home buying process, and what
            homes they are willing to buy. By acting now, you may be able to
            stay in your home for as long as possible and get the solutions you
            need. Contact us today to get started!`}
